Population dynamics for abundances calculated from meta-omics sequencing

<b> Project Background: </b>
* 88 samples: 4 replicates of high oxygen, 4 replicates of low oxygen, and 11 samples per replicate. 
* Organisms "phylogeny" is described by: Kingdom, Phylum, Class	Order	Family	Genus

<b> Project Goals: </b><br>
    Visualization:
      *plot something by phylogeny

<b> Machine Learning: </b>
* infer an interaction network
* distributed predicted dynamic model

Come up with a model for the network dynamic from 88 individual networks. 

<b> Vocabulary: </b>
* node
* phylogeny

<b> To-do: </b>
* Papers that give context to our data. 
* put a link to this public repo in each of our private repositories.
