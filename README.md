# Analysis of Bacterial Community Compositions

Population dynamics for abundances calculated from meta-omics sequencing in bacterial community samples from Lake Washington.

<b> Project Background: </b>

<ul>

<li>    88 samples: (4 replicates of high oxygen + 4 replicates of low oxygen) * 11 samples per replicate. 
<li>    Sequenced for 11 weeks:  Weeks 4 - 14. 
<li>    Oxygen conditions were switched for the last 4 samples. 
<li>    Organisms "taxonomy" is described by: Kingdom, Phylum, Class	Order, Family, Genus

<b> Next Steps: </b>

<ol>

<li>    Make one A matrix per sample per replicate (2*4*10 A matrices) & compare to the current results with one A per replicate.  
<li>    Test normalization of data before finding the A matrices so total abundance doesn't dominate signal. Remove taxa with small abundances first. 
<li>    Plot networks as node graphs now that data reduction tools are ready
<li>    Train on a subset of the data and see how predictive it is for the rest
<li>    Compare including vs omitting the last 4 samples of each series, which have the oxygen tension reversed. 
<li>    Do multiple hypothesis corrections, and use this to guide the cutoff for plotting and further analysis. 
<li>    Connect these mathematical results to our real biological questions.
