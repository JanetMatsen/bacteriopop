Population dynamics for abundances calculated from meta-omics sequencing

<b> Project Background: </b>
* 88 samples: 4 replicates of high oxygen, 4 replicates of low oxygen, and 11 samples per replicate. 
* Organisms "phylogeny" is described by: Kingdom, Phylum, Class	Order	Family	Genus

<b> Project Goals: </b><br><ol>
<li> Visualization: </li>
* plot something by phylogeny

<li> Machine Learning:</li>
* infer an interaction network
* distributed predicted dynamic model
* come up with a model for the network dynamic from 88 individual networks. <br>

<b> Vocabulary: </b><br>
* node
* phylogeny

<b> To-do: </b><br>
* Papers that give context to our data. 
* put a link to this public repo in each of our private repositories. 

<b> Why we chose the Apache License 2.0: </b><br>
The Apache License allows us to manage the software package as we please, while providing clear language regarding the terms. It makes it clear that individual contributors grant copyright license to anyone who receives the code, that their contribution is free from patent encumbrances (and if it is not, that they license that patent to anyone who receives the code,) and that use of Trademarks extends only as far as is necessary to use the product. It also includes a patent termination clause, should a lawsuit arise. The Apache licenses <b>encourage open-source development</b> and our software is made better by every person who runs it, files tickets about it, or patches it. This is invaluable contribution â€“ each user is given freedom and respect from the other members of the developer community.
