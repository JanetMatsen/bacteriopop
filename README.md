# Bacteriopop
Population dynamics for abundances calculated from meta-omics sequencing

# Project Background:
* 88 samples: 4 replicates of high oxygen, 4 replicates of low oxygen, and 11 samples per replicate. 
* Organisms "phylogeny" is described by: Kingdom, Phylum, Class	Order	Family	Genus

# Project Goals:
## Visualization:
* plot something by phylogeny

## Machine Learning:
* infer an interaction network
* distributed predicted dynamic model

Come up with a model for the network dynamic from 88 individual networks. 

# Vocabulary:
* node
* phylogeny

# To-do:
* Papers that give context to our data. 
* put a link to this public repo in each of our private repositories.
