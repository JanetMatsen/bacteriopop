Population dynamics for abundances calculated from meta-omics sequencing

<b> Project Background: </b>
* 88 samples: 4 replicates of high oxygen, 4 replicates of low oxygen, and 11 samples per replicate. 
* Organisms "phylogeny" is described by: Kingdom, Phylum, Class	Order	Family	Genus

<b> Project Goals: </b><br><ol>
<li> Visualization: </li>
* plot something by phylogeny

<li> Machine Learning:</li>
* infer an interaction network
* distributed predicted dynamic model
* come up with a model for the network dynamic from 88 individual networks. <br>

<b> Vocabulary: </b><br>
* node
* phylogeny
<br>

<b> To-do: </b><br>
* Papers that give context to our data. 
* put a link to this public repo in each of our private repositories.
