Population dynamics for abundances calculated from meta-omics sequencing

<b> Project Background: </b>
* 88 samples: 4 replicates of high oxygen, 4 replicates of low oxygen, and 11 samples per replicate. 
* Sequenced for 11 weeks:  week 4 - 14. 
* Oxygen conditions were switched for the last 4 samples. 
* Organisms "phylogeny" is described by: Kingdom, Phylum, Class	Order, Family, Genus

<b> Technology Review: </b>
* [Tehcnology Review Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D-DkrJsDJCglwkg9zL4Mdhlwke5hMF6LYhDwvJKBrQc/edit?ts=56ce5662#slide=id.g11bd0970be_0_17)

<b> Why we chose the Apache License 2.0: </b><br>

The Apache License allows us to manage the software package as we please, while providing clear language regarding the terms. It makes it clear that individual contributors grant copyright license to anyone who receives the code, that their contribution is free from patent encumbrances (and if it is not, that they license that patent to anyone who receives the code,) and that use of Trademarks extends only as far as is necessary to use the product. It also includes a patent termination clause, should a lawsuit arise. The Apache licenses <b>encourage open-source development</b> and our software is made better by every person who runs it, files tickets about it, or patches it. This is invaluable contribution â€“ each user is given freedom and respect from the other members of the developer community.
