**Report Week 3**

**Technology review**

1. Modred - Compute modal decompositions and reduced-order models easily, efficiently, and in parallel. 
2. NetworkX - Creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.
3. Graph_tool - Python module for manipulation and statistical analysis of networks.

- **Algorithm Review** 
    1. GMM - A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is a parametric probability density function represented as a weighted sum of Gaussian component densities.
    2. DBSCAN - a density-based clustering algorithm: given a set of points in some space, it groups together points that are closely packed together (points with many nearby neighbors), marking as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions (whose nearest neighbors are too far away)
    3. DMD - a dimensionality reduction algorithm developed by Peter Schmid in 2008. Given a time series of data, DMD computes a set of modes each of which is associated with a fixed oscillation frequency and decay/growth rate.

**Progress made according to schedule**

1. Demo - new file to test functions about loading data, PAC reduction
2. utils - add new functions to filt/prepare data
3. Driver - new file to run assembled functions
4. GMM_demo - new file to analyze data by Gaussian Mixture Model
5. DBscan - new file to analyze data by DBSCAN
6. DMD_demo - new file to analyze data by dynamic mode decomposition

**Tasks for upcoming week:**

1. Machine Lerning to analyse our data
2. Understanding feature interactions 
3. Data visualization.
