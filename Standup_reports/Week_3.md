# Report Week 3

<b> Technology review </b>
<ol>
<li>    NetworkX: Creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.
<li>    Graph-tool: Python module for manipulation and statistical analysis of networks.
<li>    Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM): A parametric probability density function represented as a weighted sum of Gaussian component densities.
<li>    Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN): Given a set of points in some space, it groups together points with many nearby neighbors, marking as outliers points whose nearest neighbors are too far away.
<li>    Dynamic Modal Decompostion: A dimensionality reduction algorithm. Given a time series of data, DMD computes an interaction matrix of decay/growth rates.
<li>    kd-tree: For quick nearest-neighbor lookup. This class provides an index into a set of k-dimensional points which can be used to rapidly look up the nearest neighbors of any point, provided the neighbors are indexed.
</ol>

<b> Progress: </b>
<ol>
<li>    Reducing the size of our data, for ease of use with machine learning methods
<li>    Work on scripts to perform clustering by kd-tree, Gaussian Mixture models and DBSCAN 
<li>    Work on scripts to calculate the interaction matrix
<li>    Work on demo notebooks of bacteriopop
<li>    Addition of more unit-tests.
<li>    Designing directory structure.
<li>    Tackling sparse data
</ol>

<b> Tasks for upcoming week </b>
<ol>
<li>  Completion of all code, debugging, PEP-8 compliance, documentation, performance metrics, building narrative of project and creating a poster for presentation.
<li>  Visualizing the data using Seaborn, pandas or matplotlib. 
</ol>
