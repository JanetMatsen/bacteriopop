Progress 
Scripts were written to perform these tasks:
Read two datasets and present it as a dataframe with appropriate labels.
Convert the dataframe with categorical data into a numeric feature vector. This function uses Pandas and SciKitLearn to prepare a data set with categorical columns for machine learning tasks by assigning a binary value to the properties possessed by each species in a sample.
Receive the pandas dataframe, the list of features, and a string that representing the name of the target column in data frame. The output is the correlation of each numeric feature vector with the target values and their bar plot, using a user-specified correlation method.

Tasks for upcoming week


Food for thought

How do we choose which model to use?
How do we choose which attributes of my data to include in the model?
How do we optimize this model for best performance?
How do we ensure that we're building a model that will generalize to unseen data?
Can we estimate how well my model is likely to perform on unseen data?
How do we plan to visualize our data in an easily interpretable and intuitive way?
