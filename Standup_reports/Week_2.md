# Report Week 2
<div align="justify">

<b> Progress </b>
<ol>
Scripts were written to perform these tasks:
<li>  Read two datasets and present it as a dataframe with appropriate labels.
<li>  Convert the dataframe with categorical data into a numeric feature vector. This function uses Pandas and SciKitLearn to prepare a data set with categorical columns for machine learning tasks by assigning a binary value to the properties possessed by each species in a sample.
<li>  Receive the pandas dataframe, the list of features, and a string that representing the name of the target column in data frame. The output is the correlation of each numeric feature vector with the target values and their bar plot, using a user-specified correlation method.
<li>  Principal Component Analysis for the dataframe to convert the set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables.
</ol>

<b> Deliverables for next week </b>
<ol>
<li>  Visualizing the data using Seaborn, pandas or matplotlib. Inspired by work on the famous Iris dataset.
<li>  Application of machine learning algorithms for unsupervised learning and clustering such as kd-tree, k-means or Expectation maximization (EM)
</ol>

<b> Challenges </b>
<ol>
<li>  How do we choose which attributes of my data to include in the model?
<li>  How do we optimize this model for best performance?
<li>  How do we ensure that we're building a model that will generalize to unseen data?
<li>  Can we estimate how well my model is likely to perform on unseen data?
</ol>
