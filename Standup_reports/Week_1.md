<b> Technology review </b>
<ol>

<li>  Technology 
<ol>
<li>  Scikitlearn - open source machine learning library for the Python programming language.
<li>  Custom methods, originally tailored by Saghar.
<li>  Standard libraries like numpy, pandas and matplotlib
</ol>

<li>  Motivation for these packages
Our objectives of data pre-processing, visualization and creation of an interaction network using Machine Learning methods can be achieved using these packages, in a simple and efficient manner. 

<li> Benefits of scikit-learn
<ol>
<li>  Consistent interface to machine learning models
<li>  Provides many tuning parameters but with sensible defaults
<li>  Exceptional documentation
<li>  Rich set of functionality for companion tasks
<li>  Active community for development and support
</ol>

<li>  Potential drawbacks of scikit-learn
<ol>
<li>  Steep learning curve for beginners.
<li>  Less emphasis on model interpretability than other open-source packages
</ol>
</ol>
<b> Progress</b>
<ol>
<li>  Dataset identified and approved for use (see raw_data)
<li>  Use cases and project goals listed in Task.md
<li>  Technology selected and cost-benefit analysis done in this document
<li>  Questions to be answered for further steps are listed below
</ol>

<b> Deliverables for next week </b>
<ol>
<li>  Data cleaning: throwing out data with missing labels and formatting the data from categorical values into binary values
<li>  Convert our bacteria's labels to binary format (works for < 1000)
<li>  Data visualization.  Correlation between bacteria. 
</ol>

<b> Challenges </b>
<ol>
<li>  How do we choose which attributes of my data to include in the model?
<li>  How do we choose which model to use?
<li>  How do we prepare our data for use?
<li>  How do we optimize this model for best performance?
<li>  How do we ensure that we're building a model that will generalize to unseen data?
<li>  Can we estimate how well my model is likely to perform on unseen data?
<li>  How do we plan to visualize our data in an easily interpretable and intuitive way?
</ol>
